# Movie Recommendation System

## Recommends 5 movies based on your favourite!

This project is an intelligent movie recommender. It suggests movies that have similar themes, descriptions and plot points. I used vector similarity to find movies which are alike. Future tweaks might include suggesting movies with sequels and parts only once as well as updating the movie list dataset. Enjoy your search!
